##' These function use the Boost Date_Time library to parse
##' datetimes (and dates) from strings, integers, factors or even numeric values
##' (which are cast to strings internally). They return a vector of
##' \code{POSIXct} objects (or \code{Date} objects in the case of \code{anydate}).
##' \code{POSIXct} objects represent dates and time as (possibly
##' fractional) seconds since the \sQuote{epoch} of January 1, 1970.
##' A timezone can be set, if none is supplied \sQuote{UTC} is set.
##'
##' A number of fixed formats are tried in succession. These include
##' the standard ISO format \sQuote{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} as well as
##' different local variants including several forms popular in the
##' United States.  Two-digits years and clearly ambigous formats such
##' as \sQuote{03/04/05} are ignored.  In the case of parsing failure
##' a \code{NA} value is returned.
##'
##' Fractional seconds are supported as well.  As R itself only supports
##' microseconds, the Boost compile-time option for nano-second resolution
##' has not been enabled.
##'
##' @section Notes:
##' By default, the (internal) conversion to (fractional) seconds since the epoch is
##' relative to the locatime of this system, and therefore not completely
##' independent of the settings of the local system. This is to strike a
##' balance between ease of use and functionality.  A more-full featured
##' conversion could be possibly be added with support for arbitrary
##' reference times, but this is (at least) currently outside the scope of
##' this package. See the \pkg{RcppCCTZ} package which offers some
##' timezone-shifting and differencing functionality. As of version 0.0.5 one
##' can also parse relative to UTC avoiding the localtime issue,
##'
##' Times and timezones can be tricky. This package offers a heuristic approach,
##' it is likely that some input formats may not be parsed, or worse, be parsed
##' incorrectly. This is not quite a \href{https://xkcd.com/327/}{Bobby Tables}
##' situation but care must always be taken with user-supplied input.
##'
##' The Boost Date_Time library cannot parse single digit months or
##' days. So while \sQuote{2016/09/02} works (as expected),
##' \sQuote{2016/9/2} will not. Other non-standard formats may also
##' fail.
##'
##' The is a known issue (discussed at length in
##' \href{https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/5}{issue
##' ticket 5}) where Australian times are off by an hour. This seems
##' to affect only Windows, not Linux.
##'
##' When given a vector, R will coerce it to the type of the first
##' element. Should that be \code{NA}, surprising things can
##' happen: \code{c(NA, Sys.Date())} forces both values to
##' \code{numeric} and the date will not be parsed correctly (as its
##' integer value becomes numeric before our code sees it). On the
##' other hand, \code{c(Sys.Date(), NA)} works as expected parsing as
##' type Date with one missing value. See
##' \href{https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/11}{issue
##' ticket 11}) for more.
##'
##' @section Operating System Impact:
##' On Windows systems, accessing the \code{isdst} flag on dates or times
##' before January 1, 1970, can lead to a crash. Therefore, the lookup of this
##' value has been disabled for those dates and times, which could therefore be
##' off by an hour (the common value that needs to be corrected).
##' It should not affect dates, but may affect datetime objects.
##'
##' @title Parse POSIXct objects from input data
##' @param x A vector of type character, integer or numeric with
##' date(time) expressions to be parsed and converted.
##' @param tz A string with the timezone, defaults to \sQuote{UTC} if unset
##' @param asUTC A logical value indicating if parsing should be to UTC; default
##' is false implying localtime.
##' @return A vector of \code{POSIXct} elements, or, in the case of \code{anydate},
##' a vector of \code{Date} objects.
