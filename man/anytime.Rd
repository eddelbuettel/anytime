\title{Parse POSIXct objects from input data}
\usage{
anytime(x, tz = getTZ(), asUTC = FALSE)

anydate(x, tz = getTZ(), asUTC = FALSE)

utctime(x, tz = getTZ())

utcdate(x, tz = getTZ())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of type character, integer or numeric with
date(time) expressions to be parsed and converted.}

\item{tz}{A string with the timezone, defaults to \sQuote{UTC} if unset}

\item{asUTC}{A logical value indicating if parsing should be to UTC; default
is false implying localtime.
##' @return A vector of \code{POSIXct} elements, or, in the case of \code{anydate},
a vector of \code{Date} objects.}
}
\description{
These function use the Boost Date_Time library to parse
datetimes (and dates) from strings, integers, factors or even numeric values
(which are cast to strings internall). They return a vector of
\code{POSIXct} objects (or \code{Date} objects in the case of \code{anydate}).
\code{POSIXct} objects represent dates and time as (possibly
fractional) seconds since the \sQuote{epoch} of January 1, 1970.
A timezone can be set, if none is supplied \sQuote{UTC} is set.
}
\details{
A number of fixed formats are tried in succession. These include
the standard ISO format \sQuote{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} as well as
different local variants including several forms popular in the
United States.  Two-digits years and clearly ambigous formats such
as \sQuote{03/04/05} are ignored.  In the case of parsing failure
a \code{NA} value is returned.

Fractional seconds are supported as well.  As R itself only supports
microseconds, the Boost compile-time option for nano-second resolution
has not been enabled.
}
\section{Notes}{

By default, the (internal) conversion to (fractional) seconds since the epoch is
relative to the locatime of this system, and therefore not completely
independent of the settings of the local system. This is to strike a
balance between ease of use and functionality.  A more-full featured
conversion could be possibly be added with support for arbitrary
reference times, but this is (at least) currently outside the scope of
this package. See the \pkg{RcppCCTZ} package which offers some
timezone-shifting and differencing functionality. As of version 0.0.5 one
can also parse relative to UTC avoiding the localtime issue,

Times and timezones can be tricky. This package offers a heuristic approach,
it is likely that some input formats may not be parsed, or worse, be parsed
incorrectly. This is not quite a \href{https://xkcd.com/327/}{Bobby Tables}
situation but care must always be taken with user-supplied input.

The Boost Date_Time library cannot parse single digit months or
days. So while \sQuote{2016/09/02} works (as expected),
\sQuote{2016/9/2} will not. Other non-standard formats may also
fail.

The is a known issue (discussed at length in
\href{https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/5}{issue
ticket 5}) where Australian times are off by an hour. This seems
to affect only Windows, not Linux.

When given a vector, R will coerce it to the type of the first
element. Should that be \code{NA}, surprising things can
happen: \code{c(NA, Sys.Date())} forces both values to
\code{numeric} and the date will not be parsed correctly (as its
integer value becomes numeric before our code sees it). On the
other hand, \code{c(Sys.Date(), NA)} works as expected parsing as
type Date with one missing value. See
\href{https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/11}{issue
ticket 11}) for more.
}

\section{Operating System Impact}{

On Windows systems, accessing the \code{isdst} flag on dates or times
before January 1, 1970, can lead to a crash. Therefore, the lookup of this
value has been disabled for those dates and times, which could therefore be
off by an hour (the common value that needs to be correctect).
It should not afffect dates, but may affect datetime objects.
